### What does puts do?

puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line after it

### What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, while a float is a decimal number.

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division rounds down when it's not exact. Float division will be exact. You can expalin integer division by giving the example of how much of something you can buy with a certain amount of dollars. You can't get half a movie if you don't have enough money for another movie ticket.

## Reflection

### How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles addition, subtraction, and multiplication of numbers as you would expect for regular math. For division of numbers, specifically integers, it will round down to the nearest whole number.

### What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers, while floats are real numbers or numbers with decimals.

### What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division rounds down to the nearest whole number, while float division will be exact.

### What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are a series of characters. You would use them whenever you have text or any sequence you want to reuse.

### What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables in your file. You use them to store values to be used later. This is so that you don't have to keep typing the same thing over and over again and so that you have cleaner code.

### How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This challenge was fairly simple since it was a review of what we've already had to cover for Ruby. It was a good refresher of the basics.
