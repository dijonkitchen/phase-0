### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I struggled with understanding git fetch and git merge.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Git fetch and merge were clarified for me. I usually use git pull, but it was good to see that git fetch gets the remote repository branch and git merge merges branches. So you can merge branches locally if you want.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair things to learn more about him, how they were getting adjusted to Phase 0, how they like to work, etc.

We had questions for each other and the guide about locating things on GitHub, the syntax for git fetch and git merge, and why the picture wasn't showing up properly in markdown.

### What still confuses you about git?

I get how to do pull requests online, but I'm not sure why that isn't done on the command line or if that's even possible.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

This first time pairing ever was really nice. We both taught each other things the other didn't know and it was nice to see someone else's development environment.
