<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was fairly simple to translate since it was a simple website.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was not difficult since we went through the CodeAcademy lessons already and used a simple unordered list to show all the links and a few paragraph tags for the smaller paragraph content.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We didn't use any styles or formatting of fonts (alignment, etc.). The only thing that makes the content look different were the hyperlinks added.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems good in that it's just controlling the information/content. What's bad is that each item needs to be nested in different tags. It's hard to see the intended structure without any formatting/styling.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

There are not really any "tricks." You just need to remember there is a head and a body, and often times you need to close tags after you've opened them.
