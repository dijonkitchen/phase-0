### What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, while a float is a decimal number.

Integer division rounds down when it's not exact. Float division will be exact. You can expalin integer division by giving the example of how much of something you can buy with a certain amount of dollars. You can't get half a movie if you don't have enough money for another movie ticket.
