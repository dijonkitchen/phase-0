### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to showcase my skills in web development. The kind of content it'll feature will include blog posts to communicate my thoughts on various subjects as well as the design and user experience of the website.

### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience for my site are web developers and employers of web developers. My site will address them by having technical blog posts and a great user experience navigating the site.

### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action a user takes when coming to my site now is to browse through the blog posts. If they want to know more about me, there are posts on my history as well as an About page which provides some background on the site. On the bottom of each page are the links to my Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub accounts in case they ever want to contact me.

### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The main thing people should know about design and user experience is that it is a custom deliverable. It's form and functions are different depending on the end user's needs and wants. Thus, there's no simple template that everyone can use to achieve a great design or user experience.

### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is optimizing for the end user's thoughts and feelings. They should feel delighted to go to your site, navigate around it, and potentially buy something if that's what your trying to do. It's valuable because the focus is not directly on what you or some company wants, but what your customers and vistors want.

### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Making the sitemap was the most tedious part for me. There aren't great, free sitemap generators out there and my site is fairly simple. I ended up opting for a simple Google Slide slide and taking a snapshot of it. This seems to suffice for now.
