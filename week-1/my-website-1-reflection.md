### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on GitHub, you just register an account on GitHub and on the top right click on the '+' button and click 'new repository'.

Then you copy the clone URL on the bottom right. You clone your repository by opening up your Terminal on your Mac and typing in 'git clone ' and pasting in the clone URL you copied.

### Describe what open source means.

Open source means code that anyone can edit and change. Often times there are licenses associated with these open source projects and you may need to abide by their varied terms.

### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think Open Source makes a lot of sense. In a world that is very connected with people from different backgrounds with different ideas, you can improve upon software considerably if they all work together. My only withdrawal is that because of the vast amounts of people and ideas, there may be a lack of focus or consensus on priorities. This leads to a more fragmented software universe with everyone just doing their own thing instead of working together.

### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are important for maintaining the integrity of software. With the right openness or restrictions, people can work together on things to make things better (or different) and not have others steal hard work.

### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

While I've already made a GitHub Pages blog, I've solidified more of my command line skills using the Terminal and syncing my local and remote repositories. Because I've been interested in these topics for a long time, I've read on them on my own before and there weren't any "aha" moments. It was nice to see other opinions on text editors and open source software.

### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
