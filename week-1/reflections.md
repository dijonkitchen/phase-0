# Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

I've learned about starting small, easy habits and focused meditation.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time boxing is setting a certain amount of time for tasks. This allows for a set, short-term goal that you can achieve.


How do you manage your time currently?

I currently manage my time in a structured fashion. I usually set goals at the beginning of the day for the tasks I want to complete. More recently, I've downloaded a Pomodoro Timer App on my Mac. I love productivity "hacks" and I've heard about the Pomodoro technique a while ago in my own research.


Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

It's still early, so I don't know how I'll adjust it yet, but it helps my eyes from tiring and keeps a good rhythm for getting things done. Historically, since I didn't always structure it with time boxes, things would get delayed or forgotten. Hopefully this will help.


Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

I've thought about meditation for a while, but I try to integrate my lifestyle so that chores like cleaning are my meditation. I'm testing out small exercises while I take breaks to keep my back and core muscles strong for good posture. This small change should be easy so hopefully I'll naturally love it and do more.


What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

I'm thinking the classic Pomodoro time of 25 minutes and 5 minute breaks, with a 30 minute break after 2 hours will work for now. During the breaks, I'll do some pull-ups and rest my eyes. Longer breaks are for meals and walks outside to get some fresh air and also rest my eyes.


# The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is the command line terminal that lets you move and edit files or folders. bash is the name of the shell on Mac OSX.



What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

It was most challenging to memorize all the keyboard commands.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

While following through the instructions I was able to use the commands taught.


In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

The most important commands are probably cd, mv, rm, ls, touch, mkdir, grep, less, and the operators >, <, and |. These allow you to navigate your hard drive and create, move, find, and edit files or folders.


Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd: print working directory; shows what folder you're currently in

-ls: list files and folders in current directory

-mv: moves/renames files/folders

-cd: change directory

-../: don't know

-touch: create a new file

-mkdir: make a new directory

-less: pages through a long file

-rmdir: removes a directory

-rm: removes a file or folder

-help: windows's manual page. Is "man" for bash


# Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

Create an account on GitHub.com
Create a new Repository on the top left under the '+' sign
Go to another person's repository and click the 'Fork' button on the top right
On the bottom right of your newly forked repository, copy the HTTPS clone URL
Open your terminal and type in "git clone ", paste the clone URL you copied, press enter
You would want to fork a repository so that you can work off of someone else's work that's already been established. There's no need to create a new one and start from scratch. Additionally, since the repositories are linked by the fork, you can be notified of changes to the original's source code.


What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

Setting up git and GitHub was fairly painless for me since I already had a GitHub account. What I did learn was more of the command line and using it to navigate, clone, commit, pull requests, and push. Making changes to a file, then committing them, and adding descriptions was new to me. Having used the web and application interface previously, forcing myself to just use the terminal will take a little work, but I'm confident I'll get used to it since developers need to use git and GitHub all the time.
