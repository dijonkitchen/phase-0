What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?

I reviewed some uses of class methods and variables. I learned that binary search was trickier than I thought. Originally I wanted to use the size of the array instead of inputing the low and high index values, but since I need to return the original array's index, I need to keep the whole index structure to return it.

What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

I was able to find a bsearch method for Ruby but wasn't sure how to use it properly for this task.

What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

Algorithms and data structures are really interesting, so I might look into that depending on next week's work load.
