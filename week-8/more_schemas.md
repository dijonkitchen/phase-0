### What is a one-to-one database?

A one-to-one database is a database that stores a one-to-one relationship, as in a country and it's capital.

### When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

In general when things go together in a pair.

### What is a many-to-many database?

Many-to-many databases are databases that store many-to-many relationships, as in classes and students.

### When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

In general, when there is a group that creates a group of things.

### What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

I'm not sure yet why there need to be all these relationships mapped out. In the real world, it seems most things would be one-to-many or many-to-many anyway. What makes sense to me is the use of unique keys as an identifier for a table.
