### What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a rough layout of how you want a webpage to look.

### What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits are that you can quickly figure out what layouts you or the end user prefers instead of working a long time coding out details that can change.

### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

It was nice to think at a high level about how things are structured rather than how they would look visually.

### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I went through a few iterations to get to something I liked.

### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Finding an approriate tool for wireframing was tricky. Although I though paper and pencil was the fastest, it wasn't easily scalable for more pages. I ended up using Google Draw since it was free and simple to build a wireframe on.

### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Making the wireframe itself was a bit tedious on the computer. The trackpad isn't a very efficient method for making a lot of boxes and text.
