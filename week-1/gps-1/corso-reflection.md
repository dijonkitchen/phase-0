## What git concepts were you struggling with before the GPS session
I had yet to use the seperate 'fetch' and 'merge' commands. I also had some problems with pushing branches and having them not show in GitHub. 
## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
As I said above, git fetch and merge were commands I had yet to use, so it was good to see that there are multiple options for reviewing the pull request. Also some of the lingo like 'staging' was reinforced. Also remembering to check the git log to see if things have gone through properly.
##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair about his current state of being and seeing how he was doing. I asked a few basic questions about his history. Asked how phase 0 was going and just about the basic workflow of the program so far. 

We asked the guide questions about git fetch and merge, specifically for the syntax involved since it was a little confusing on the site. We also had some problems getting out image to load, so we asked a couple questions on the markdown syntax. 

## What still confuses you about git?
I have had problems with my 'push' command not automatically showing on the website, but it is something I have been able to work around. So I am a little confused as to why it doesn't do that when my syntax is correct. 

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think this was a really good first experience. We were both open to suggestions when driving, and John was patient and respectful as a navigator. I learned a few things from him, and I got to see the Mac side of things. It was good to work with another student for the first time.
